            Summer of 2014 I was contacted by Kids with Dreams (a student group that lead activities involving disabled children) to redesign their website. It was aimed at informing students and parents of the organization and about upcoming events. The site they previously had was from early 2000s and they needed something new to conform to the new standards. I decided to use bootstrap to make thier site mobile-friendly since it will be mostly accessed by students and parents in Silicon Valley. It is currently a work in progress and undergoing changes so stay tuned. <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/kwd/">KWD Website</a>

          <p class="lead">SwitchMate was a mechatronics project that involved working with Android devices. SwitchMate is a device you magnetically attach to light switches. This device can be actuated from your phone to physically flick switches in your home. <br><br>

          On this team, I focused on wireframes and logo designs for our application. Here you can see our logo (a circuit diagram symbol for a switch) and the menus used to find devices via bluetooth and add devices to your home screen. <br><br>

          We went on to demo this product to a few VCs and entrepreneurs in a friendly competition in our class. We were judged as the most impressive team and won a free dinner (nom nom nom).

           They charge phones using fire. <br><br>

At FlameStower, I did a lot of things. I built a full fledged website and integrated third-party shopping cart software so that the site could start accepting pre-orders. I took photographs of the product in use to populate the website and our social media pages. And I did a lot of materials strength tests to see which alloys would work best under intense heat. But mainly I focused on the web page. Ah, the good ole start up days. After I left, the website went through many revisions. But if you would like to see more of my work with FlameStower, scroll down and grab my email.</p>

          You're looking at this right now! When I first started learning web development, I really wanted to build everything from scratch. After learning how intricate it was to build sites, I decided to take a look at Twitter Bootstrap 3.0. I've been busting out sites faster now but I am looking at different ways to customize my layouts. I am currently experimenting with using the bootstrap infrastructure to make completely custom user interfaces for my clients so that they get sites that look radically different from your standard bootstrap build. <br><br>

          I'm ready to create some breathtaking sites. How about yours?
