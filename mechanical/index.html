          <p class="lead">
            During my time at Nokia, I created a watch housing for an LED watch that had a UV sensor mounted on it. This watch would encourage people who work indoors to go out and get a minimum amount of sunlight. Why? Because researchers have determined that people need at least 20 minutes of sunlight (this figure changes with skin type). <br><br>

            The watch housing along with all of its components can be seen tightly packaged on the CAD drawing. In addition to the UV Sensor, it was packed with a piezoelectric sensor, RGB LEDs, and a lithium-ion battery. The housing was 3D printed on PolyJet and requires no screws. It is permanently attached with a back cover that snaps to the main housing. </p>

          <p class="lead">For our Mechatronics class, we had to build and code up a robot that would push other robots out of a ring. Pretty much it was robot sumo wrestling. 

Our electronic systems had to detect an IR pulse being emitted from other robots and use that data to act accordingly. Along that, we had to direct power flow to the motors to make sure they were able to spin both ways. 

We used an Arduino Uno to program our robot and control which direction our motors would spin in. Arduino was also used to determine the strength of the pulse and how to respond when it got stronger.

At the end of our project, we had a massive robot fight. It was a free-for-all. It was a mess. It was awesome.</p>

          <p class="lead">For my Design and Manufacturing class I decided to make a pocket Telescope. It required extensive use of the lathe to make grooves, threads, and notches. The telescope was made from 6061 Aluminum and Delrin. It took about 4 weeks to go from rough prototype to finish project. Multiple iterations and rapid prototyping helped me make sense of how all the parts would fit together and create a finished product. <br><br>

          You can see the final product in the picture above in all of its glory. I took the photo too. Pro tip: Beautifully presenting products is just as important as making them.

          <p class="lead">In 2012, a few friends and I came together to enter the Red Bull Flugtag competition. We were tasked to create a man-sized glider and launch it and the pilot off the top of a pier into the water below. Our team name was Suit Up!

After weeks of design meetings, trips to Home Depot and countless late nights. We had built a plane that spectacularly crashed into the water.

          <p class="lead">For my Mechanical Systems Design Class, me and my teammates were tasked to create a mechanical rabbit that could hop up a slanted path. 

Using a small motor, a gear train, and a simple linkage, we were able to simulate a bunny hop and get it to run pretty fast. One thing I like to point out here is the balance between form and function. See those big floppy ears. They aren't there just to look pretty. They were critical in making sure our rabbit stayed within the track. See that? Form and function, ladies and gentlemen, form and function.</p>
